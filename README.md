## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The main challenge was just figuring out how to use Xcode and swift. The CodePath swift introduction was helpful to learn the basics. 

## App Brainstorming

Favorite apps and their features:

# X/Twitter
- Trending topics page
- User curated feed

# Bleacher Report
- The team feed
- The ability to comment on other posts

# Spotify
- Spotify Wrapped
- See what your friends are listening to

# Obsidian
- Ability to create notes in markdown
- Ability to publish vault online

# My App Idea:
I want to create an app that leverages the NBA stats API and allows users to watch play by play 5-10 second clips of each player in the NBA. So for example, say Luka Doncic shoots and misses a three pointer. This play will be tracked and the user can click on a container that will show the clip. The user can search for any player and the app will update once a day, during the season, with all new tracked plays.
